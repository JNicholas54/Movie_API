        <h1> Find my movie API</h1>
        <p>This is my documentation file requiere to give you instructions in how to use this API. Hear we have the requirements for this API to work:</p>
        <p>
            "The objective of this projects is to build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
            application will provide users with access to information about different
            movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies."
        </p>

        <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The API must be a Node.js and Express application.</li>
            <li>The API must use REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data operations listed above</li>
            <li>The API must use at least three middleware modules, such as the body-parser package for reading data from requests and morgan for logging.</li>
            <li>The API must use a â€œpackage.jsonâ€ file.</li>
            <li>The database must be built using MongoDB.</li>
            <li>The business logic must be modeled with Mongoose.</li>
            <li>The API must provide movie information in JSON format.</li>
            <li>The JavaScript code must be error-free.</li>
            <li>The API must be tested in Postman.</li>
            <li>The API must include user authentication and authorization code.</li>
            <li>The API must include data validation logic.</li>
            <li>The API must meet data security regulations.</li>
            <li>The API source code must be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub.</li>
            <li>The API must be deployed to Heroku.</li>
